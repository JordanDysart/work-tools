## Hide the Admin Toolbar

Are you tired of that pesky admin toolbar covering up the bottom tenth of your viewport. It honestly takes too many milliseconds to respond to our requests to minimize it. It's not ideal.

Let's find an quick and easy way to hide it. **Drag the link into the bookmark bar to try it out.** 

[Hide Admin Toolbar](javascript:(function(){document.location='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ'})();)

## What is a bookmarklet?

It's just a few lines of javascript that you can run from the bookmark bar. These should allow us to access information that is stored on any website, you just have to click the bookmarklet to run it.

## How do I add a bookmarklet to my browser?

Visit this site then click and drag any of the bookmarklet links into your bookmark bar.

## What am I running?

If you are curious what the javascript code looks like you can right click and edit the bookmarklet. You will find all of the javascript sitting inside of the URL text input box. 

If anyone has any ideas or questions feel free to slack me.
